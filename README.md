# Heat Map

In this project I create a heat map to display the monthly global land-surface temperature from 1753 to 2015.
This is a project from the freeCodeCamp course and I made it using the D3.js library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/heat-map-d3.git
```

Go inside the **heat-mapd3** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/heat-map-d3/).


## Main features

* In this project I used D3.js version 5.
* The x-axis is a time scale representing the year from 1753 to 2015.
* The y-axis is a time scale representing the month of the year.
* You can mouse hover an area of the map (each area corresponds to a specific month of a specific year) and see a tooltip which displays more information about the selected area.
* There is a legend that correlates a specific color to the land surface temperature measured in a specific time (the base temperature is 8.66Â°C).


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
